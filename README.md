#FA3D: Fast and Accurate 3D Object Detection

> Fast and accurate detection of objects, in 3D, is one of the critical components in an advanced driver assistance system. In this paper, we aim to develop an accurate 3D object detector that runs in near real-time on low-end embedded systems. We propose an efficient framework that converts raw point cloud into a 3D occupancy cuboid and detects cars using a deep convolutional neural network. Even though the complexity of our proposed model is high, it runs at 7.27 FPS on a Jetson Xavier and at 57.83 FPS on a high-end workstation that is 18% and 43% faster than the fastest published method while having a comparable performance with state-of-the-art models on the KITTI dataset. We conduct a comprehensive error analysis on our model and show that two quantities are the principal sources of error among nine predicted attributes.
